# Blockchain Game

## General Idea and Gameplay

It will be a 3d strategy game with cards, were two player will battle with units, until the base of a player gets destroyed (or time runs out?).
 
Each player creates a deck of cards beforehand and enters the duel. At the start of the duel, both players have 10 mana crystals and are dealt 5 cards from the top of their deck. Each card represents a unit and has mana cost and stats (some might have special powers). A player can chose to play any card, as long as the mana is sufficient, and set the unit of the card wherever is possible on the battlefield (*Generally, the battlefield will be divided in two halfs, one for each player*). When set, the unit will follow a route to destroy the enemy's base and kill enemy units in its path.

### Mana Crystals

A total of 10 mana crystals are given to the player at the start of the game. Every card played consumes crystals according to its mana cost. Mana replenishes over time until it fills up to 10. Some cards might affect total mana, or replenish rate for a sort period of time.

### Units

//Todo: Discuss about units

### Blockchain

There are two main usages of blockchain capabilities:

1) Every unit (and every other in game item, if any) will be a [Non Funguble Token](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) in the blockchain. It can be used in game or traded to third party markets, according to the choice of blockchain we make.

2) The game will have its own [token](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crypto-token.asp). Tokenomics are yet to be discussed. One of its uses will be as a reward after a player wins a duel.
