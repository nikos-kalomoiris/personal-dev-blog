# Task Issue Handling

We can use tools for integrating the ticketing system with version control, for a better developing experience. In case our ticketing system is different from the git repo hosting service (Github), the developer should update the issue with the hash of the commit that "closes" it, in the details of the issue. For example:

```text
commit: (commit hash)
Author: (Name)
Date:   (Date)
       
(Area of update/change) Title.

Description
```

```text
commit: 2fb109cb1a6c53f69c38cea38112617c1b3fcd64
Author: Nick Kal
Date:   Mon Jul 20 14:09:37 2021 +0300
