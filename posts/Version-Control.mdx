# Version Control

## Git is used as the main version control system

### The development process is ticket driven and the git flow model is used for features development. During this process:

1. The team is assigning **task issues** to all it's members with a ticketing system (Trello, Jira etc.)
2. Each ticket represents a **feature** and it will be developed on it's own branch. The git branching model we will use is [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). 
3. Every issue is ranked based on it's priority and organized in categories (in progress, for review etc.) 
4. After a feature's development is completed, the developer sets his code for code review, by creating a **merge request** in github.

**The task issue process should always start before code development**.

## Example of gitflow model

Initially, we create a new `feature-X` branch from the latest upstream `develop` branch and add code to individual commits. Ideally, every commit must be independent, bring about a very specific changes and change the minimum possible files, accompanied by a descriptive message for the future reader. Periodically, the developer can upstream repository pushes the `feature-X` branch in which he/she works localy.
When the developer finishes a feature's development, sets his/hers code for code review, by creating a **merge request** in github.

An **other** team member (reviewer, committer) reviews the authors code
,probably asks for changes and, finally, merges the `feature-X` branch in `develop`. Ideally, to avoid conflicts and merge commits during merge, the `feature-X` branch should be rebased above most recent `develop` branch.

**Author**:
```bash
# Create new local branch `feature-X` from upstream `develop`
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature-X

# Do some work
git commit -am "Implement feature-X"

# Rebase local `feature-X` over the latest upstream `develop`
git fetch
git rebase origin/develop

# Push local `feature-X` upstream, before the merge request
git push origin feature-X
```

**Reviewer**:
```bash
# Bring the latest `develop` locally
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Merge `feature-X` into local `develop`
git merge feature-X

# Push the local `develop` branch upstream
git push origin develop

# Cleanup both local and upstream `feature-X`
git branch -D feature-X
git push origin --delete feature-X
```
