## Stage 1: Defining Requirements

In this stage, the team should describe the requirements as clearly as possible. During this process the team determines:

1. The operations that the application must perform.
2. What the User Interface will look like, with the use of mockups and the desired user experince.
3. Estimate the delivery date of the application in production.
4. Demonstration dates of the application in dev environment

## Stage 2: Design
   ### Intro
   ### Ok
   ### Hello
After defining the requirements, the development team is invited to take
design decisions for implementation. During this process
are determined:

1. The architecture and the structural parts of the application, eg Database,
   in-memory data store, frontend, backend, etc.
2. The technologies that will be used. (solidity, vue etc.)
3. The tools that will be used for its construction and delivery
   implementation. (dev ops)
4. the ticketing system in which the technical objectives and application schedule are recorded as well as the versioning system.

## Stage 3: Implementation

After designing the application, the development team begins to analyze a technician
level the required functionality and divides it into smaller, simpler
and independent pieces.
